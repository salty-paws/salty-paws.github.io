        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hola! My name is Naari! I've been involved with animal care since I was 15. My love for dogs and cats began when I moved back to the Caribbean after living a few years in Laguna Beach, California. Returning to Puerto Rico, I was heartbroken to see so many stray animals, and immediately felt called to help. That passion led me to volunteer work, and soon after, I found myself helping families integrate shy or sensitive adopted pets into their homes.</p>
        <p>In the last few years I have also worked with active dogs that help keep me in shape and inspire me to spend more time outdoors! Being away from their environment and/or family doesn't have to be a stressful experience for your pup. I aim to create a positive, enriching experience, where they're free to roam the house (no crates unless requested) and enjoy plenty of time in nature.</p>
        <p>With your approval, I can even offer safe, supervised off-leash adventures in secure outdoor spaces.</p>
        <p>As a bonus, I'm also a photographer! I offer fun beachside dog photography session for an additional fee â€” perfect for capturing special memories of their stay.</p>
        <p>Daily photos and videos are always included, along with bathing or brushing if needed during their stay. I look forward to caring for your furry family member like one of my own!</p>
